MilSymbol
=========

MilSymbol is a small library in pure javascript that creates SVG symbols according to MIL-STD-2525 and APP6. All unit symbols with SIDCs in both 2525(c) and APP6(b) are supported. The symbols are created according to APP6(c) symbology and might therefore differ from the  symbols in shown in the standard documents, but they are made according to the standards and follows the way that symbols are created in ADRP 1-02 (US Army Doctrine Reference Publication).
At the moment APP6(B) ANNEX D / 2525C APPENDIX A (Unit Symbols) and 2525C APPENDIX D (Signals intelligence symbols) and APPENDIX E (Stability operations symbols) / parts of unit symbols for 2525D are implemented in this library.

The library is published under a BSD-license so you can do basically anything you want with it as long as you give it some credit. All of the code was created as a proof of concept and was initially just thought as a simple way for me to get symbols for some webmapping demos I was making as a hobby, but the code expanded into something much more.

MilSymbol logs the current version number to the console when it is initiated.

Still in the process of moving my code, so go to http://spatialillusions.com/MilSymbolLibrary/ to read more about the project.
